# Introduction to clojure-pills

Welcome to Clojure Pills, a weekly screencast about the functions in the Clojure standard library!

This folder contains show notes for each episode, including the snippets illustrated at the REPL or other code that might be useful. Enjoy!

### Next episodes

* [ ] = is a good one, introducing all the equality stuff. It can be one of those seemingly simple operator that instead opens up endless discussions.
* [ ] constantly: is one of the free samples. Should be easy and simple enough but I just did another higher order, would wait.
* [ ] condp goes into some interesting details about the so many forms and the history regarding it. But no perf analysis on its own. I could revise it.
* [ ] defn: I'd like to tackle defn at some point, but probably in a two parts screencast.
* [ ] for is when I want some complete tool. Probably a two part, or a long-ish one.
* [x] trampoline: I though about trampoline as a bit esoteric, with strong connections to functional programming and recursion.
